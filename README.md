## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Desktop-first workflow
- React Router
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - React Library For styles

### What I learned

One of the few React projects i just decide to use no external library, even for NavbarðŸ˜’. I only made use one external library, which is the styled-components used to apply styles directly to components.
I learnt how to manage complex states and create better responsive designs using modern css with the likes of "clamp".
